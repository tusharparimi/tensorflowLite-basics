# tensorflowLite-basics
This projects implements some simple flower classification and handwritten digits classififcation models. The idea is to play with tensorflowLite to create models that can run on low resource devices in real-time.

### Results
- Flower classification

### Flow
- The CNN neural network models are trained in the jupyter notebook files(.ipynb) and saved as a tensorflow-Lite model.
- Those Lite model are then used in the real-time video capture .py scripts to classify flowers and handwritten digits in real-time.
